 
 The Russian Armed Forces possess the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the 
world, surpassing the arsenal of the United States. They operate the second-
largest fleet of ballistic missile submarines, and are one of only three militaries
(alongside China and the United States) that operate strategic bombers. Russia
maintains a powerful aerial and naval force. In 2021, Russia had the fifth-highest
military expenditure in the world at US$65.9 billion. Russian law mandates one-
year drafting for all male citizens aged 18â€“27. However, deficiencies have 
been noted in combat performance, both on the tactical and the operational scales, 
during the Invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with different parts of the military 
struggling to work together.

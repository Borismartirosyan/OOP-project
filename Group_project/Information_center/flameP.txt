Most military flamethrowers use liquid fuel, typically either gasoline or diesel, but 
commercial flamethrowers are generally blowtorches using gaseous fuels such as propane;
gases are safer in peacetime applications, because their flames have less mass flow 
rate and dissipate faster, and often are easier to extinguish when necessary. The 
military use of flamethrowers is restricted through the Protocol on Incendiary Weapons.
Apart from the military applications, flamethrowers have peacetime applications where 
there is a need for controlled burning, such as in sugarcane harvesting and other 
land-management tasks. Various forms are designed for an operator to carry, while others
are mounted on vehicles. The man-portable flamethrower consists of two elementsâ€”the
backpack and the gun. The backpack element usually consists of two or three cylinders. 
In a two-cylinder system, one cylinder holds compressed, inert propellant gas (usually 
nitrogen), and the other holds flammable liquid, typically some form of petrochemical. 
A three-cylinder system often has two outer cylinders of flammable liquid and a central
cylinder of propellant gas to maintain the balance of the soldier carrying it.

The RPG warhead being used against tanks and other armor often has a shaped charge explosive
warhead. A shaped charge is an explosive charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive's
energy. Various types are used to penetrate tank armor; typical modern lined shaped charge can
penetrate steel armor needed to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge
(charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10 CD and above have been achieved. Despite
the popular misconception that shaped charges "melt" tank armor, the shaped charge does not
depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the superplastic metal
jet from a shaped charge impact on armor forms mainly due to a sudden and intense mechanical
stress and does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely due to kinetic energy
in nature. An RPG comprises two main parts: the launcher and a rocket equipped with a warhead.
The most common types of warheads are high explosive (HE) and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT)
rounds. HE rounds can be used against troops or unarmored structures or vehicles. HEAT rounds
can be used against armored vehicles.

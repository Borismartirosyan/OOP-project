 
 The Republic of China Armed Forces are the armed forces of the Republic of China 
(ROC), formerly based in mainland China and currently in its remaining jurisdictions 
which includes the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and other smaller ROC 
islands such as Taiping Island in the South China Sea.They consist of the Army, Navy 
(including the Marine Corps), Air Force and Military Police Force. The military is under 
the civilian control of the Ministry of National Defense, a cabinet-level agency 
overseen by the Legislative Yuan. It was previously named the National Revolutionary 
Army before being renamed as the Republic of China Armed Forces in 1947 due to the 
implementation of the newly promulgated Constitution of the Republic of China.
It was also historically referred as the Chinese National Armed Forces prior to
the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland and the 
gradual loss of international recognition in the 1970s by the United Nations and many
countries such as the United States.

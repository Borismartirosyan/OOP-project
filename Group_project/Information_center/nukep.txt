In the mid-1950s, the United States had an unconditional superiority over the USSR in nuclear
weapons, although thermonuclear charges had already been created in the USSR at this time. Also,
there were no effective means of delivering nuclear warheads to the US, both in the 1950s and in
1961. The USSR was not therefore able to muster a possible realistic retaliatory nuclear strike
against the US. Given the Soviet Union's actual strategic disadvantage in relation to America's
nuclear weapons possessions, foreign policy and propaganda considerations during the leaderships
of Georgy Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev made a response to the perceived US nuclear blackmail
imperative. The creation of the Tsar Bomba represented a necessitated bluff in order to maintain
the concept of nuclear deterrence. Also on June 23, 1960, the Resolution of the Council of
Ministers of the USSR was issued on the creation of a super-heavy ballistic missile N-1
( GRAU index – 11A52) with a warhead weighing 75 tonnes (83 short tons) (for a comparative
assessment – the weight of the warhead tested in 1964, by the UR-500 ICBM was 14 tonnes.

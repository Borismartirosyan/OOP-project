Early ICBMs had limited precision, which made them suitable for use only against the largest targets,
such as cities. They were seen as a "safe" basing option, one that would keep the deterrent force
close to home where it would be difficult to attack. Attacks against military targets (especially
hardened ones) still demanded the use of a more precise, manned bomber. Second- and third-
generation designs (such as the LGM-118 Peacekeeper) dramatically improved accuracy to the point
where even the smallest point targets can be successfully attacked. ICBMs are differentiated by
having greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles: intermediate-range ballistic missiles,
medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and tactical
ballistic missiles. Short and medium-range ballistic missiles are known collectively as the theatre
ballistic missiles. The first practical design for an ICBM grew out of Nazi Germany's V-2 rocket
program. The liquid-fueled V-2, designed by Wernher von Braun and his team, was widely used by
Nazi Germany from mid-1944 until March 1945 to bomb British and Belgian cities, particularly
Antwerp and London.

 
 The Japan Self-Defense Forces also known as the Japanese Armed Forces, are the 
unified military forces of Japan established in 1954. The self-defence forces 
consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense 
Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. They are controlled by the Ministry of 
Defense, with the Prime Minister as commander-in-chief. In recent years, the JSDF has 
engaged in international peacekeeping operations with the United Nations. Tensions, 
particularly with North Korea, have reignited debate over the status of the JSDF 
and its relation to Japanese society. Since 2010, the JSDF has refocused from 
countering the former Soviet Union to the People's Republic of China; increased
military cooperation with Australia, India, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, the 
United Kingdom and the United States; and acquired new or updated equipment and 
hardware.

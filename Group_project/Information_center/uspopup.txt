    The United States Army is the land service branch of the United States Armed Forces.
The Army's five core competencies are prompt and sustained land combat, combined
arms operations (to include combined arms maneuver and wideâ€“area security,armored
and mechanized operations and airborne and air operations),special operations,to set
and sustain the theater for the joint force,and to integrate national, multinational,
and joint power on land.The Continental Army was created on 14 June 1775 by the
Second Continental Congress  as a unified army for the colonies to fight Great
Britain, with George Washington appointed as commander. The army was initially
led by men who had served in the British Army or colonial militias and who brought
much of British military heritage with them.As the Revolutionary War progressed,
French aid, resources and military thinking helped shape the new army.A number of
European soldiers came on their own to help, such as Friedrich Wilhelm,who taught
Prussian Army tactics and organizational skills.

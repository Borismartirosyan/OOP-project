In 1934, the German Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres) commissioned
Krupp of Essen to design a gun to destroy the forts of the French Maginot Line that 
were nearing completion. The gun's shells had to punch through seven metres of 
reinforced concrete or one full metre of steel armour plate, from beyond the range
of French artillery. Krupp engineer Erich MÃ¼ller calculated that the task would 
require a weapon with a calibre of around 80 cm, firing a projectile eighing 7 
tonnes from a barrel 30 metres long. The weapon would have a weight of over 1000 
tonnes. The size and weight meant that to be at all movable it would need to be 
supported on twin sets ofrailway tracks. In common with smaller railway guns, 
the only barrel movement on the mount itself would be elevation, traverse being 
managed by moving the weapon along a curved section of railway line. Krupp prepared
plans for calibres of 70 cm, 80 cm, 85 cm, and 1 m. Nothing further happened
until March 1936 when, during a visit to Essen, Adolf Hitler inquired as to the 
giant guns'feasibility. No definite commitment was given by Hitler, but design work 
began on an 80 cm model.

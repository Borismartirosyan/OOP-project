The thermobaric device yields the equivalent of 44 tons of TNT using about seven tons 
of a new type of high explosive. Because of this, the bomb's blast and pressure wave 
have a similar effect to a small tactical nuclear weapon. The bomb works by detonating
in mid-air. Most damage is inflicted by a supersonic shockwave and extremely high 
temperatures. Thermobaric weapons differ from conventional explosive weapons in that
they generate a longer, more sustained blast wave with greater temperatures. In doing
so, they produce more damage over a larger area than a conventional weapon of similar
mass. Some defense analysts question both the yield of the bomb and whether it could 
be deployed by a Tupolev Tu-160 bomber. A report by Wired[4] says photos and the video
of the event suggest that it is designed to be deployed from the rear of a slow moving 
cargo plane, and they note that the bomb-test video released by the Russians never 
shows both the bomb and the bomber in the same camera shot. There are also questions
on what type of explosives it used. They quoted Tom Burky, a senior research scientist
at Battelle, saying "It's not even clear what kind of weapon the Russians tested.

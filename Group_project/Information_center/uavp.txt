An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is defined as a "powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a
human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be
piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload".
UAV is a term that is commonly applied to military use cases. However missiles with warheads are
not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a munition. The term unmanned aircraft system
was adopted by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap
2005â€“2030. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the British Civil Aviation
Authority adopted this term, also used in the European Union's Single-European-Sky (SES)
Air-Traffic-Management (ATM) Research (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020. This term
emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft. It includes elements such as
ground control stations, data links and other support equipment. A similar term is an
unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS), remotely piloted
aerial vehicle (RPAV), remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). Many similar terms are
in use. "Unoccupied" and "uninhabited" are occasionally used as alternatives to "unmanned".

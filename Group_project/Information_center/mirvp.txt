The first true MIRV design was the Minuteman III, first successfully tested in 1968 and introduced
into actual use in 1970.The Minuteman III held three smaller W62 warheads of about 170 kilotons of
TNT (710 TJ) each in place of the single 1.2 megatons of TNT (5.0 PJ) W56 used in the earlier
versions of this missile. From 1970 to 1975, the United States would remove approximately 550
earlier versions of the Minuteman ICBM in the Strategic Air Command's (SAC) arsenal and replace
them with the new Minuteman IIIs outfitted with a MIRV payload, increasing their overall
effectiveness. The smaller power of the warhead was offset by increasing the accuracy of the system,
allowing it to attack the same hard targets as the larger, less accurate, W56. The MMIII was
introduced specifically to address the Soviet construction of an anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
system around Moscow; MIRV allowed the US to overwhelm any conceivable ABM system without
increasing the size of their own missile fleet. The Soviets responded by adding MIRV to their
R-36 design, first with three warheads in 1975, and eventually up to ten in later versions.
While the United States phased out the use of MIRVs in 2014 to comply with New START,
Russia continues to develop new missile designs using the technology.
